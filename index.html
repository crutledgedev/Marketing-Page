        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

        <p>In 2015, an estimated 150 million people worldwide were homeless. Our mission is to provide a reliable network of communication with a single point destination. Connecting social workers, humanitarian aid providers and the communities they serve with the families of those who may be searching for each other, regardless of organization, affiliation or geographic location. </p>

        <h3>Our Volunteers</h3>
        <p>Our volunteers are actively involved with organizations that provide community outreach, humanitarian relief and access to critical care services to homeless communities in their local regions. </p>
        <p>From Social Workers, Church volunteers, soup-kitchen workers and all points in between. Volunteers are the contact point bridging the gap, posting new alerts and receiving messages when a response or post is submitted.</p>

        <h3>View Posts Anonymously</h3>

        <p>Anyone can view active postings. No account is required to view or post, however, if you are looking for a family member we will need some way to get in contact with you in the event one of our volunteers is able to make a connection. </p>
        <p>If you are searching for a loved one who may be struggling with maintaining a stable line of contact due to the homelessness or related hardships, maybe we can help.</p>
